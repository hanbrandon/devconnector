# devconnector
Devconnector is social network web application for developers. When user creates account, it imports user's github repositories automatically. Users can edit profile, create posts, write comments, and like other users' posts. 

Front-end was done by React.js, CSS, and Bootstrap. Back-end was done by Node.js, and I used MongoDB for the database.
